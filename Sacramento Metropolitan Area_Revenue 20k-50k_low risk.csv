Unit investment trust companies (1) are organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument; (2) do not have a board of directors; and (3) issue only securities redeemable at the request of the security holder, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities, but does not include voting trusts. Face-amount certificates, sometimes referred to as guaranteed face-amount certificates, are essentially obligations of the issuing company to pay a fixed sum at a specified maturity date and usually require periodic payments by the purchaser.","[[{u'position': u'Vice President at Hickox Financial Corporation', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'Main': u' 916-654-0466', u'name': u'Rebecca Hickox', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States'}]]",Investors syndicates, 6726990,
