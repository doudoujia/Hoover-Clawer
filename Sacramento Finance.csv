United States","Retirement Security Center is primarily engaged in issuing unit investment trusts or face-amount certificates; and in issuing shares, other than unit investment trusts and face-amount certificate companies, whose shares contain no provision requiring redemption by the company upon request of the security holder. Unit investment trust companies (1) are organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument; (2) do not have a board of directors; and (3) issue only securities redeemable at the request of the security holder, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities, but does not include voting trusts. Face-amount certificates, sometimes referred to as guaranteed face-amount certificates, are essentially obligations of the issuing company to pay a fixed sum at a specified maturity date and usually require periodic payments by the purchaser.","[[{u'name': u'Shasta Hague', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'VIP Client Service Manager and Operations at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' shasta.hague@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Jacqueline Frese', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Investment Manager at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' jackie.frese@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Alyson Zeitler', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Executive Assistant at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' alyson.zeitler@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Kevin Campbell', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Advisor at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' kevin.campbell2@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Kelley Carter', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' kelley.carter@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'John Findley', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Advisor at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' john.findley@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Mike Lockwood', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Advisor at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' mike.lockwood@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Travis Simas', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Advisor at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' travis.simas@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Julie Kahle', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Office Facilitator at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' julie.vonkahle@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Lori Carden', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License #0C95928 at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' lori.carden@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Bonnie Farrell', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License #0D21904) at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' bonnie.farrell@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Nancy Fletcher', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' nancy.fletcher@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Greg Glunt', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' greg.glunt@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Ken Leonardini', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' ken.leonardini@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Briggs Matsko', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License #0507622 at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' briggs.matsko@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Brandi Stahl', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License #0D58931) at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' brandi.stahl@rscenters.com'}], [{u'name': u'Jake Wilson', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States', u'position': u'Financial Planner (CA Insurance License #0E60259) at Retirement Security Center', u'Main': u' 916-868-3900', u'Email': u' jake.wilson@rscenters.com'}]]","Investment offices, nec", 6726000,www.retirementsecuritycenters.com

Unit investment trust companies (1) are organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument; (2) do not have a board of directors; and (3) issue only securities redeemable at the request of the security holder, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities, but does not include voting trusts. Face-amount certificates, sometimes referred to as guaranteed face-amount certificates, are essentially obligations of the issuing company to pay a fixed sum at a specified maturity date and usually require periodic payments by the purchaser.","[[{u'position': u'Principal at Scici Invenstments, LLC', u'industry': u'Pensions and Funds', u'name': u'Sandra Borg', u'location': u'Sacramento, California, United States'}]]","Investment offices, nec", 6726000,
